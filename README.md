## About the Project
This project was developed and hosted on the Replit platform with
third party user authentication provided with Auth0 by Okta. This game was my first experience with web development and it was extremely satisfying to watch it all come together
as I learned more about web frameworks, database management, routing, and Javascript. I certainly ran into a handful of obstacles and as a result of my growth over time, there are many
things that I would now change about this project.

I do not assert that this project is the most secure or efficient project, but working on this game turned out to be a tremendous learning experience for me and has inspired excitement for the
next user-focused application.
